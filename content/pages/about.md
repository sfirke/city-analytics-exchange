City Analytics Exchange is a peer-led community of data-using professionals working in local government.

## Our Mission

We seek to share knowledge, ideas, and best practices in how to put a city's data to work for its residents and staff. There's no need to reinvent the wheel everywhere.

## Our Community

Our members range from individual contributors up to the C-suite level, at small, mid-sized, and large cities and counties in the US and Canada. We also have a few members at regional government entities like transit authorities.

As of 2026, we have about 100 members in our Slack chat and a couple of dozen attendees at our bi-monthly [meetings](/meetings).

## Get In Touch

Our Slack and meetings are open to anyone working in local government. If that's you, ping Sam Firke on LinkedIn and he'll get you a link to the Slack and add you to the calendar invites.
